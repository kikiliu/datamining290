I built up a web service to display the relationship of twitter accounts which are followed by ischool.

1. Run on localhost:
run ipython notebook and use the URL below
http://127.0.0.1:8888/files/D3_visualize_twitter_relationship/index.htm
2. Select by six different features using drop-down list

I also made screen shot in TwitterRelationByRetweet.png as an example
